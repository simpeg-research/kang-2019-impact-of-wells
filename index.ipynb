    "### Locally\n",
    "To run them locally, you will need to have python installed, preferably through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then clone this repository. From a command line, run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/simpeg-research/kang-2018-spectral-inducedpolarization.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `cd` into the `kang-2018-spectral-inducedpolarization`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd kang-2018-spectral-inducedpolarization\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup your software environment, we recommend you use the provided conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "source activate sip-environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "alternatively, you can install dependencies through pypi\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "You can then launch Jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter will then launch in your web-browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell of code can be run with `shift + enter` or you can run the entire notebook by selecting `cell`, `Run All` in the toolbar.\n",
